                uncommon for people to exchange quotes from their favorite movies or cater the contents of their closets to reflect the style of 
                their favorite musician or fictional character.
                Visual media is particularly good at conveying products and ideas. You know it's a reliable phenomenon when major advertisers start 
                to participate. As early as the 1920s, companies paid huge sums to have their products featured on big screens. The 1927 Best Picture
                 Oscar winner 'Wings' featured product placement for the Hershey Company's  (HSY) - Get Free Report famous candy bar. It's a time-honored 
                 accepted ideal that movies can influence the habits of audience members.
                Advertising is all well and good, but not every idea that comes from a movie is as wholesome as a chocolate bar. Need an example? Just 
                take this Washington-based software engineer who took too much inspiration from one cult classic movie. 
                A former software engineer for the Seattle-based e-commerce company Zulily has been charged in a rather interesting case of 
                fraud. Ermenildo “Ernie” Valdez Castro allegedly stole more than $300,000 using a variety of schemes involving altering site 
                code to manipulate pricing or double-charge customers, moving the funds into his own personal Stripe account, Geekwire reports.
                If you’ve seen the cult classic “Office Space”, this probably sounds familiar. In the movie, a disgruntled office employee does the same 
                thing, stealing fractions of cents from the company and diverting it to a personal account. After waiving his Miranda rights, Valdez Castro 
                told detectives that he was inspired by the movie, even referring to his plan as the “OfficeSpace project” in notes found by police. 
                According to Valdez Castro, Zulily was aware of his plans to a certain degree -- he’d been fired from the company in June of 2022 after 
                an internal investigation. Once the evidence was found on his laptop, Valdez Castro was arrested. Last week, he was charged with two 
                counts: first-degree theft and first-degree identity theft.",

                frequently companies give priority to hiring internally for roles and may even provide financial help to complete courses and/or certifications,” she says.
                
                In addition, programmers can look to gain experience in areas that are not part of their existing job responsibilities.
                “You can volunteer to help solve a particular problem by identifying key pain points you and your colleagues may
                experience, and step up by suggesting solutions,” Blackwell says. “This offers an opportunity to learn on the job, and
                be recognized by superiors for your helpful contributions.”

                Another way to get on-the-job experience is to look for opportunities at smaller companies, “which are often a great
                place for developers to do just this because team members often wear multiple hats,” Blackwell says. “You can typically
